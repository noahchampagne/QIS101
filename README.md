# Foundations of Quantum Information Science (QIS101)

## Using Jupyter and IBM Qiskit

# Hello! This folder contains all the projects and tests done during my time at BNL during Summer 2023! We heavily used various packages such as skipy, matplotlib, numpy, and IBM's Qiskit to pursure various scientific computing tasks. Feel free to glance through, and I'd love to comment on some of the projects in interviews! Thank you!

# Lab 19: ifs_fern.py is some pretty simple code, but also one of my favorite projects if you want something to check out!
